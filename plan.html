<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Jake Regattieri</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>
The goal when creating the Slammers Beach Volleyball website will focus primarily to grab the attention of teenagers from approximately fifteen and up who are still attending school attempting to increase customer numbers by at least 50% ensuring an easy to use interface for all of my target audience. I intend to use a colour palette that encapsulates the sports colours to reach Slammers Beach Volleyball’s target audience creating a Fun but competitive Feel to the website. 
</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Success Evaluation will be measured by the numbers of of people signing up on the Slammers Beach Volleyball website as well as a overall growth in the community and profit for the company.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target Audience for the slammers Beach Volleyball website will be diverse capturing the attention of younger audience aged 15 - 30. To get the attention of my target audience I must make sure not to use colours that are too bright as teenagers would be put of by bright colours associating the sport with being childish, instead going for a slightly more professional design capturing the fun and competiveness of Beach Volleyball.</p>
